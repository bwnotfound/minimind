* This open-source project aims to train a miniature language model **MiniMind** from scratch, with a size of just 26MB.
* **MiniMind** is extremely lightweight, approximately $\frac{1}{7000}$ the size of GPT-3, designed to enable fast
  inference and even training on CPUs.
* **MiniMind** is an improvement on the DeepSeek-V2 and Llama3 architectures. The project includes all stages of data
  processing, pretraining, SFT, and DPO, and features a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model.
* This is not only the implementation of an open-source model, but also a tutorial for getting started with large
  language models (LLMs).

# 📌 Introduction

In the field of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, LLaMA, GLM, etc., while their performance is impressive, the
massive model parameters—often in the range of 10 billion—make them difficult to train or even infer on personal devices
with limited memory. Most users do not settle for merely fine-tuning large models using methods like LoRA to learn a few
new instructions. It's akin to teaching Newton to use a 21st-century smartphone, which is far removed from the essence
of learning physics itself.

Additionally, the abundance of flawed, superficial AI tutorials offered by subscription-based marketing accounts
exacerbates the problem of finding quality content to understand LLMs, severely hindering learners.

Therefore, the goal of this project is to lower the barrier to entry for working with LLMs as much as possible, by
training an extremely lightweight language model from scratch.

> [!CAUTION]
> As of 2024-09-17, MiniMind has trained three model versions, with the smallest model requiring only 26M (0.02B)
> parameters to achieve smooth conversational abilities!

| MiniMind-V1 (108M)      | 6400             | 1.0 GB                 | 2024.09.01   | 60'                      |

> This analysis was run on an RTX 3090 GPU with Torch 2.1.2, CUDA 12.2, and Flash Attention 2.

The project includes:

- Public MiniMind model code (including Dense and MoE models), code for Pretrain, SFT instruction fine-tuning, LoRA
  fine-tuning, and DPO preference optimization, along with datasets and sources.
- Compatibility with popular frameworks such as `transformers`, `accelerate`, `trl`, and `peft`.
- Training support for single-GPU and multi-GPU setups(DDP、DeepSpeed), Use wandb to visualize the training process. The
  training process allows for stopping and resuming at any point.
- Code for testing the model on the Ceval dataset.
- Implementation of a basic chat interface compatible with OpenAI's API, facilitating integration into third-party Chat
  UIs (such as FastGPT, Open-WebUI, etc.).

We hope this open-source project helps LLM beginners get started quickly!

# 📌 Data sources

- 🤖 Tokenizer: In NLP, a Tokenizer is similar to a dictionary, mapping words from natural language to numbers like 0, 1,
  36, etc., which can be understood as page numbers in the "dictionary" representing words. There are two ways to build
  an LLM tokenizer: one is to create a vocabulary and train a tokenizer yourself, as seen in `train_tokenizer.py`; the
  other is to use a pre-trained tokenizer from an open-source model.

  You can use a standard dictionary like Xinhua or Oxford. The advantage is that token conversion has a good compression
  rate, but the downside is that the vocabulary can be very large, with tens of thousands of words and phrases.
  Alternatively, you can use a custom-trained tokenizer. The advantage is that you can control the vocabulary size, but
  the compression rate may not be ideal, and rare words might be missed.

  The choice of "dictionary" is crucial. The output of an LLM is essentially a multi-class classification problem over N
  words in the dictionary, which is then decoded back into natural language. Because LLMs are very small, to avoid the
  model being top-heavy (with the embedding layer's parameters taking up too much of the model), the vocabulary length
  should be kept relatively small.

  Powerful open-source models like 01万物, 千问, chatglm, mistral, and Llama3 have the following tokenizer vocabulary
  sizes:
    <table>
      <tr><th>Tokenizer Model</th><th>Vocabulary Size</th><th>Come from</th></tr>
      <tr><td>yi tokenizer</td><td>64,000</td><td>01-AI（China）</td></tr>
      <tr><td>qwen2 tokenizer</td><td>151,643</td><td>Alibaba Cloud（China）</td></tr>
      <tr><td>glm tokenizer</td><td>151,329</td><td>Zhipu AI（China）</td></tr>
      <tr><td>mistral tokenizer</td><td>32,000</td><td>Mistral AI（China）</td></tr>
      <tr><td>llama3 tokenizer</td><td>128,000</td><td>Meta（China）</td></tr>
      <tr><td>minimind tokenizer</td><td>6,400</td><td>Custom</td></tr>
    </table>

  > 👉Update on 2024-09-17: To avoid ambiguity from previous versions and control the model size, all Minimind models now
  use the Minimind_tokenizer for tokenization, and all versions of the Mistral_tokenizer have been deprecated.

  > Although the Minimind_tokenizer has a small length and its encoding/decoding efficiency is weaker compared to
  Chinese-friendly tokenizers like Qwen2 and GLM, the Minimind models have opted for their custom-trained
  Minimind_tokenizer to maintain a lightweight parameter structure and prevent an imbalance between encoding and
  computation layers. This is because the Minimind vocabulary size is only 6,400.
  > Moreover, Minimind has not encountered any issues with decoding rare words in practical tests, and the performance
  has been satisfactory. Due to the custom vocabulary being compressed to 6,400 tokens, the total parameter size of the
  LLM is minimized to only 26M.

# 📌 Model

MiniMind-Dense (like [Llama3.1](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/)) uses a Transformer Decoder-Only architecture.
The differences from GPT-3 are:

* It employs GPT-3's pre-normalization method, which normalizes the input of each Transformer sub-layer rather than the
  output. Specifically, it uses the RMSNorm normalization function.
* It replaces ReLU with the SwiGLU activation function to enhance performance.
* Like GPT-Neo, it omits absolute position embeddings in favor of Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), which improves
  performance for inference beyond the training length.

---

The MiniMind-MoE model is based on the MixFFN mixture-of-experts module from Llama3
and [DeepSeek-V2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04434).

* DeepSeek-V2 adopts more granular expert partitioning and shared expert isolation techniques in the feed-forward
  network (FFN) to improve the performance of experts.

---

The overall structure of MiniMind remains consistent, with minor adjustments in RoPE calculations, inference functions,
and FFN layer code. The structure is illustrated in the figure below (redrawn):

1. **Pretraining (Text-to-Text)**:
    - LLMs first need to absorb a vast amount of knowledge, much like filling a well with ink. The more "ink" it has,
      the better its understanding of the world will be.
    - Pretraining involves the model learning a large amount of basic knowledge from sources such as Wikipedia, news
      articles, common knowledge, books, etc.
    - It unsupervisedly compresses knowledge from vast text data into its model weights with the aim of learning word
      sequences. For instance, if we input “Qin Shi Huang is,” after extensive training, the model can predict that the
      next probable sentence is “the first emperor of China.”
   > The learning rate for pretraining is set dynamically between 1e-4 and 1e-5, with 2 epochs and a training time of
   less than one day.
    ```bash
    torchrun --nproc_per_node 2 1-pretrain.py
    ```

2. **Single Dialog Fine-Tuning**:
    - After pretraining, the semi-finished LLM has almost all language knowledge and encyclopedic common sense. At this
      stage, it only performs word sequences without understanding how to chat with humans.
    - The model needs fine-tuning to adapt to chat templates. For example, it should recognize that a template
      like “<chat start> Qin Shi Huang is <chat end>” indicates the end of a complete conversation, rather than just
      generating the next word.
    - This process is known as instruction fine-tuning, akin to teaching a knowledgeable person like Newton to adapt to
      21st-century chat habits, learning the pattern of messages on the left and responses on the right.
    - During training, MiniMind’s instruction and response lengths are truncated to 512 to save memory. Just as we start
      with shorter texts when learning, we don’t need to separately learn longer articles once we master shorter ones.
   > During inference, RoPE can be linearly interpolated to extend lengths to 1024 or 2048 or more. The learning rate is
   set dynamically between 1e-5 and 1e-6, with 5 epochs for fine-tuning.
    ```bash
    # Set dataset to sft_data_single.csv in 3-full_sft.py
    torchrun --nproc_per_node 2 3-full_sft.py
    ```

3. **Multi-Dialog Fine-Tuning**:
    - Building on step 2, the LLM has learned a single-question-to-answer chat template. Now, it only needs further
      fine-tuning on longer chat templates with historical question-and-answer pairs.
    - Use the `history_chat` field for historical dialogues and `history_chat_response` for historical responses in the
      dataset.
    - Construct new chat templates like [question->answer, question->answer, question->] and use this dataset for
      fine-tuning.
    - The trained model will not only answer the current question but also conduct coherent dialogues based on
      historical interactions.
    - This step is not strictly necessary, as small models have weak long-context dialogue abilities, and forcing
      multi-turn Q&A templates may slightly compromise single-turn SFT performance.
   > The learning rate is set dynamically between 1e-5 and 1e-6, with 2 epochs for fine-tuning.
    ```bash
    # Set dataset to sft_data.csv in 3-full_sft.py
    torchrun --nproc_per_node 2 3-full_sft.py
    ```

4. **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**:
    - After the previous training steps, the model has basic conversational abilities. However, we want it to align more
      closely with human preferences and provide more satisfactory responses.
    - This process is similar to workplace training for the model, where it learns from examples of excellent employees
      and negative examples to better serve customers.

📋 Regarding LLM parameter configuration, an interesting paper [MobileLLM](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14905) provides
detailed research and experiments.
The scaling law exhibits unique patterns in small models. The parameters that significantly influence the scaling of
Transformer models are primarily `d_model` and `n_layers`.

* `d_model`↑ + `n_layers`↓ -> Short and wide models
* `d_model`↓ + `n_layers`↑ -> Tall and narrow models

The Scaling Law proposed in 2020 posits that the amount of training data, parameter count, and training iterations are
the key factors determining performance, with the influence of model architecture being nearly negligible. However, this
law seems not to fully apply to small models.
MobileLLM suggests that the depth of the architecture is more important than its width. A "deep and narrow" model can
learn more abstract concepts compared to a "wide and shallow" model. For instance, when the model parameters are fixed
at 125M or 350M, a 30–42 layer "narrow" model significantly outperforms a 12-layer "short and wide" model. This trend is
observed across eight benchmark tests, including common sense reasoning, question answering, and reading comprehension.
This is a fascinating discovery, as previously, few attempts were made to stack more than 12 layers when designing
architectures for small models around the 100M parameter range. This aligns with the observations from MiniMind, where
adjusting parameters between `d_model` and `n_layers` during training produced similar effects.
However, "deep and narrow" has its limitations. When `d_model` < 512, the disadvantages of collapsing word embedding
dimensions become very pronounced, and increasing layers does not compensate for the shortcomings in `d_head` caused by
fixed `q_head`. Conversely, when `d_model` > 1536, increasing layers seems to have a higher priority than `d_model`,
providing a better "cost-performance" ratio and effect gain.
Therefore, MiniMind sets `d_model = 512` and `n_layers = 8` for the small model to achieve a balance between "minimal
size <-> better performance." For greater performance gains, `d_model = 768` and `n_layers = 16` are set, aligning
better with the scaling law for small models.

[D]: The main food of giant pandas is bamboo.
[E]: Giant pandas are herbivores that primarily eat bamboo. Their digestive system is adapted to process the high cellulose content of bamboo, but they also consume some other plants, such as herbaceous plants and small mammals. Their digestive system includes enzymes like "cellulase" to break down cellulose, helping them digest a large amount of fiber and nutrients. Additionally, they have "cellulose protein" that helps maintain their energy levels, aiding their survival in the wild. Overall, bamboo is their primary food, but they also eat other plants and small mammals.

[Q]: Why is seawater salty?
[A]: Seawater contains many salts, which increase its salinity. The salts in seawater mainly come from the dissolved salts and form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, increasing the salinity.
[B]: Seawater contains abundant elements like calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and phosphorus, which are limited in quantity and distribution in the ocean. Additionally, seawater contains nutrients from various organisms and microorganisms, such as shells and seaweeds.
[C]: Seawater contains many dissolved salts, with the most common being sodium chloride. When salt is added to water, its molecules react with water molecules to form sodium hydroxide, which is a type of salt.
[D]: Water is essential for many organisms, as it can absorb and release carbon dioxide, release oxygen,
[E]: The primary reason seawater is salty is due to the high concentration of dissolved salts, with sodium chloride (NaCl) being the most significant. Sodium chloride is a very common salt that is present in most regions of the Earth, including oceans, lakes, rivers, and groundwater. When water evaporates from the ocean, it carries away some of the salt, making the seawater salty. Additionally, seawater contains other dissolved salts such as sulfates, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, magnesium potassium sulfate, magnesium sodium sulfate, magnesium calcium sulfate, magnesium magnesium calcium sulfate, magnesium magnesium calcium sulfate, magnesium magnesium calcium sulfate, magnesium magnesium sodium sulfate, magnesium magnesium calcium sulfate, magnesium magnesium magnesium calcium sulfate, magnesium magnesium magnesium

## 👉 Summary of Effects

* The ranking of the minimind series (ABC) aligns with intuition, with minimind-v1(0.1B) scoring the highest, and its
  responses to common sense questions are mostly error-free and free of hallucinations.
    * Surprisingly, minimind-v1-small(0.02B), with only 26M parameters, can perform nearly as well as minimind-v1(0.1B).
    * minimind-v1(0.1B) underwent less than 2 epochs of SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) due to being prematurely killed to
      free up resources for smaller models. Despite not being fully trained, it still achieved the best performance,
      demonstrating that larger models generally outperform smaller ones.
    * minimind-v1-moe(0.1B) performed only slightly better than minimind-v1-small(0.02B), also due to early termination
      to free up resources for other training. However, the MoE (Mixture of Experts) model, with its sparse
      multi-Experts mode, requires more training epochs to fully activate and train all FFN (Feed-Forward Network) layer
      experts. In the current setup with 3 epochs, the training is not yet sufficient.
      Early experiments with minimind on the Yi-Tokenizer showed that a fully trained MoE version could outperform dense
      small models visibly. This aspect may need to be reserved for future training and updates to v2 and v3 versions
      when more server resources are available.

* The responses from Model E appear to be quite good to the naked eye, although there are occasional instances of
  hallucinations and fabrications. However, both GPT-4o and Deepseek's evaluations consistently noted that it "provides
  overly verbose and repetitive information, and contains hallucinations."
  This evaluation seems somewhat strict, as even a small number of hallucinated words in a 100-word response can easily
  result in a low score. Given that Model E was pre-trained on longer texts and a larger dataset, its responses appear
  more comprehensive. In models of similar size, both the quantity and quality of the data are crucial.

# 📌 Objective Dataset: C-Eval

C-Eval evaluation code is located at: `./eval_ceval.py`.

For small models, to avoid issues with fixed response formatting, we directly judge the prediction probabilities of the
four tokens `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, and choose the one with the highest probability as the answer, then calculate accuracy
against the standard answer. Note that minimind models were not trained on larger datasets or fine-tuned for question
answering, so results should be considered as reference only.

### Model Performance Insights from GPT-4o

```text
### Areas Where the Model Excels:
1. **High School Chemistry**: With an accuracy of 42.11%, this is the strongest area for the model, suggesting a solid grasp of chemistry-related knowledge.
2. **Discrete Mathematics**: Achieving an accuracy of 37.50%, the model performs well in mathematics-related fields.
3. **Education Science**: The model shows good performance in education-related topics with a 37.93% accuracy.
4. **Basic Medicine**: The accuracy of 36.84% indicates strong performance in foundational medical knowledge.
5. **Operating Systems**: With a 36.84% accuracy, the model demonstrates reliable performance in computer operating systems.

### Areas Where the Model Struggles:
1. **Legal Topics**: The model performs poorly in legal-related areas such as Legal Professional (8.70%) and Tax Accountant (20.41%).
2. **Physics**: Both high school (26.32%) and college-level (21.05%) physics topics are challenging for the model.
3. **High School Politics and Geography**: The model shows low accuracy in these areas, with High School Politics at 15.79% and High School Geography at 21.05%.
4. **Computer Networking and Architecture**: The model struggles with Computer Networking (21.05%) and Computer Architecture (9.52%).
5. **Environmental Impact Assessment Engineering**: The accuracy is only 12.90%, indicating weak performance in environmental science.

### Summary:
- **Strengths**: Chemistry, Mathematics (especially Discrete Mathematics), Education Science, Basic Medicine, and Operating Systems.
- **Weaknesses**: Legal Topics, Physics, Politics, Geography, Computer Networking and Architecture, and Environmental Science.

This suggests that the model performs well in logical reasoning, foundational sciences, and some engineering disciplines but is weaker in humanities, social sciences, and certain specialized fields (such as law and taxation). To improve the model's performance, additional training in humanities, physics, law, and environmental science may be beneficial.
